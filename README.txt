ScyDev Drupal7 CRM
##################

About
-----
This is a very simple CRM tool put together with Drupal7 and some modules.
In fact, it is so simple that it only contains time logging for tasks/customers and automatically creating invoices.

No coding was necessary except for a few lines of PHP to calculate the totals in the Views module. Which means this is just a bundle of Drupal7 and some modules and the actual work is in the configuration in the DB dump.

ScyDev Drupal7 CRM is released under the same license as Drupal7, namely the GPL v2, included with this package.



Setup
-----
* Just create a new web in your environment and use the Drupal7 folder contained in this package as its docroot.
* Load the DB dump.



Node types
----------
These should give you an overview of what can be handled with this simple CRM tool.

* Customer
* Work (type of work with separate prices: design, development, etc.)
* Task
* Time (time spent on task)
* Expense
* Invoice



How to use
----------
You should know your way around the Drupal7 backend in order to use this tool.

* Create initial content for the above node types: customers, work types, tasks
* Whenever you work on a task, create a new Time-node where you specify start and end time
	- There is a convenient clone function on the Time-node, so you can just copy and adjust start/end time
* When a task is done, create a new Invoice-node for it
	- You can put more than one task on the same invoice
	- The invoice can be printed directly with Chrome browser
	
	
	
Styling the invoice
-------------------
The invoice node is based on the Panels module. To change it, edit the "Node template" page and rearrange to your hearts content.
* Upload a new image and replace the ScyDev logo on the invoice page.
* Edit the CSS in the bartik template if needed
* Use UI and content translation to adapt to your language
